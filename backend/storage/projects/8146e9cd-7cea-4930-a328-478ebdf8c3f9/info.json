By construction the solver conserves mass,\nmomentum, and energy and is entropy stable. The method is designed to treat the\ndivergence-free constraint on the magnetic field in a similar fashion to a\nhyperbolic divergence cleaning technique. The solver described herein is\nespecially well-suited for flows involving strong discontinuities. Furthermore,\nwe present a new formulation to guarantee positivity of the pressure. We\npresent the underlying theory and implementation of the new solver into the\nmulti-physics, multi-scale adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulation code\n$\\texttt{FLASH}$ (http://flash.uchicago.edu). The accuracy, robustness and\ncomputational efficiency is demonstrated with a number of tests, including\ncomparisons to available MHD implementations in $\\texttt{FLASH}$.","year":2016,"journal":"Journal of Computational Physics, Volume 317, 15 July 2016, Pages\n  223-256","path":"/home/huntfeng/projects/research-helper-quasar/backend/storage/projects/8146e9cd-7cea-4930-a328-478ebdf8c3f9/paper1.pdf","projectId":"8146e9cd-7cea-4930-a328-478ebdf8c3f9","projectType":"paper","notes":{"861d311a-719f-4fc9-bc04-972988436d6c":{"noteName":"New Note","projectId":"8146e9cd-7cea-4930-a328-478ebdf8c3f9","links":{"forward":[],"backward":[]},"noteId":"861d311a-719f-4fc9-bc04-972988436d6c"}}}
