Cranmer","abstract":"This paper presents closed-form analytic solutions to two illustrative\nproblems in solar physics that have been considered not solvable in this way\npreviously. Both the outflow speed and the mass loss rate of the solar wind of\nplasma particles ejected by the Sun are derived analytically for certain\nillustrative approximations. The calculated radial dependence of the flow speed\napplies to both Parker's isothermal solar wind equation and Bondi's equation of\nspherical accretion. These problems involve the solution of transcendental\nequations containing products of variables and their logarithms. Such equations\nappear in many fields of physics and are solvable by use of the Lambert W\nfunction, which is briefly described. This paper is an example of how new\nfunctions can be applied to existing problems.","year":2004,"journal":"Am.J.Phys. 72 (2004) 1397-1403","path":"storage/projects/6d492c29-418e-460b-9b5b-9cf2a4d93c83/paper3.pdf","projectId":"6d492c29-418e-460b-9b5b-9cf2a4d93c83","projectType":"paper","notes":{"4c91afdc-1a2a-43bf-931e-b2583e0cee75":{"noteName":"123","projectId":"6d492c29-418e-460b-9b5b-9cf2a4d93c83","noteId":"4c91afdc-1a2a-43bf-931e-b2583e0cee75","links":{"forward":[],"backward":[]}}},"files":["4c91afdc-1a2a-43bf-931e-b2583e0cee75.md","annotations.json","info.json","paper3.pdf","pdfstate.json"]}
