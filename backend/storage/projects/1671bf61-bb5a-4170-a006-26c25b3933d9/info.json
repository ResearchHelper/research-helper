By construction the solver conserves mass,\nmomentum, and energy and is entropy stable. The method is designed to treat the\ndivergence-free constraint on the magnetic field in a similar fashion to a\nhyperbolic divergence cleaning technique. The solver described herein is\nespecially well-suited for flows involving strong discontinuities. Furthermore,\nwe present a new formulation to guarantee positivity of the pressure. We\npresent the underlying theory and implementation of the new solver into the\nmulti-physics, multi-scale adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulation code\n$\\texttt{FLASH}$ (http://flash.uchicago.edu). The accuracy, robustness and\ncomputational efficiency is demonstrated with a number of tests, including\ncomparisons to available MHD implementations in $\\texttt{FLASH}$.", "year": 2016, "journal": "Journal of Computational Physics, Volume 317, 15 July 2016, Pages\n  223-256", "path": "storage/projects/1671bf61-bb5a-4170-a006-26c25b3933d9/paper1.pdf", "projectId": "1671bf61-bb5a-4170-a006-26c25b3933d9", "projectType": "paper"}
