FIXME:

TODO:
[ ] use cytoscape.js to visualize the knowledge network

IMPROVE:
vditor
[ ] able to open it in a separate window, like zotero
[ ] figure out how vditor gets the image in dev mode, the base_url http://localhost:9300 is getting in the way. In production mode it is okay.

highlight annotation
[ ] make the join rectangle algo more robust

pdfreader
[ ] writing db too frequent due to quickly changing pages

UI
[ ] set global var systembarheight, toolbarheight, and tabsheight. So we can refer them more quickly

extractor
[ ] the filepath must start from projects/...
