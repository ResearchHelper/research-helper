FIXME:
[x] external links in pdf must open in default browser
[x] able to hit enter to finish entering identifier
[x] changing the color of the annot card, but the comment icon didn't change color

TODO:
[x] use the native system bar instead

IMPROVE:
library page
[ ] put all projects to library page, so all components can share projects?

vditor
[ ] user help menu on our own web?
[ ] able to scale image
[ ] figure out how vditor gets the image in dev mode, the base_url http://localhost:9300 is getting in the way. In production mode it is okay.

highlight annotation
[ ] make the join rectangle algo more robust

UI
[ ] set global var systembarheight, toolbarheight, and tabsheight. So we can refer them more quickly

backend
[x] documentation for each file, description of data
