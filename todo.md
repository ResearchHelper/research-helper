FIXME:
[x] scroll to selected annotation
[ ] able to modify meta info both in library page and reading page, that means infoPane must independently get/set project infos without relying on the selectedProject
[ ] ?? project store needs improvement, it seems we only need selected/working/opened project's id rather than the whole project

TODO:
[x] Note backend
left menu / right menu
[ ] use expansion item instead of tab

content extractor
[ ] make content extractor as online service

IMPROVE:
pouchdb
[ ] create all neccessary index in db.js instead of each file

veditor
[ ] in a separate window, like zotero
[ ] paste image data too long
[ ] upload image

highlight annotation
[ ] make the join rectangle algo more robust

pdfreader
[ ] writing db too frequent due to quickly changing pages

UI
[ ] set global var systembarheight, toolbarheight, and tabsheight. So we can refer them more quickly

extractor
[ ] the filepath must start from projects/...
