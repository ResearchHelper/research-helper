FIXME:

TODO:

IMPROVE:
vditor
[ ] figure out how vditor gets the image in dev mode, the base_url http://localhost:9300 is getting in the way. In production mode it is okay.

highlight annotation
[ ] make the join rectangle algo more robust

pdfreader
[ ] opens comment editor directly without opening right menu

UI
[ ] set global var systembarheight, toolbarheight, and tabsheight. So we can refer them more quickly
