annotation list
[x] FIXME: set activeAnnotation class using selectedAnnot
[ ] add comment to annotation list when comment is created
[ ] FIXME: shouldn't use scrollIntoView, first we need to change to the page where the annotation is on then use scrollIntoView (optional). I need to reformat the annotation storage in order to quickly find the corresponding page.
